"The bibtex extension allows `BibTeX <http://www.bibtex.org/>`_ citations "
"to be inserted into documentation generated by `Sphinx <https://www"
".sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_, via a ``bibliography`` directive, along "
"with ``:cite:p:`` and ``:cite:t:`` roles. These work similarly to LaTeX's"
" ``thebibliography`` environment and the ``\\citet`` and ``\\citep`` "
"commands."
